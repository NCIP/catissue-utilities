Welcome to the caTissue Utilities Project!
=====================================

caTissue Utilities has following components:
* caGridLogger: 
	** Query all services by service name i.e. query all caTissueSuite, all caArraySvc, caNanoLabSvc, caTissueCore etc.
	** Query on a specific named grid – currently NCI production and training grids.
	** Specify a list of classes to be queried for a particular service type.
	** Log count of each class in a service instance. 
	** Log time taken for query, any error/exception that occurred for a particular query.
	** Support easy display, reporting and analysis of results over time.
* Bioreposreport:
	** BioreposReport is a prototype for a simple or minimal object model describing the content of a biorepository and the distributions made from it. Both the content (inventory) and distributions are described at the level of specimen type and collection protocol.
* caTissueCoreAPIExamples
	** Example to run catissue core APIs.
* caTissueLoader:
	** Load data from text files. This permits loading of participants, specimen collection groups and specimens plus the basic classes that go along with them such as registrations, collection and received events.
